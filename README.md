## How to run

## Manually

### Setup

1. cd to cmd
2. If needed run "go clean" & "go build" in each subdir of cmd

### Supervisor

- ./supervisor {supervisor_port}
  
### Worker(s)

- ./worker {hostname}:{supervisor_port} {worker_port}
  
### Client

- ./client {optional flags} {hostname}:{supervisor_port} {path to file name}
- {optional flags}:
        - -args: Command line args for file, for example "-la" when using ls
        - -range: A range of numbers to distribute work, for example: 1-10
        - -runs: Number of times to run the file

### Setup with script

- ./simple_test.sh
  - -hn {hostname}: specify hostname (Default = 'http://127.0.0.1')
  - -sp {supervisor port}: specify the supervisor port (Default = 5001)
  - -wc {workers}: specify number of workers (Default = 1)
  
### Client setup with script

- Same as manual use

## Cleanup

For now cleanup is done by using ctrl-c on the workers and the supervisor,
then exiting all windows. For the script, you can do ctrl-b d to detach from
the current window. This will fully exit all running code.

## Testing

A good way to test our program and get an idea of how the work is distributed
is to use this script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo $1
```

The optional arg is a range split amongst workers. For 1-10, the supervisor
will create 10 jobs and split it amongst the workers.
The output should be the numbers 1-10 printed out in no particular order.

## Supported File Types

- .java
- .class
- .sh
- .py
- portable executables (with env included in file)
- system programs (ls, hostname, etc.)
